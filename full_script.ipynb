    "# Secure Emails\n",
    "\n",
    "By Sally Lee and Zara Coakley\n",
    "\n",
    "When you send an email, you want to know the content of your message is private. Did you know that email isn't end-to-end encrypted, meaning that it's possible for your email provider or outside individuals to intercept and read your email messages? Not cool. One solution to this? Public-key cryptography.\n",
    "\n",
    "Public-key cryptography uses the concept of public and private keys to encrypt your messages in a way that anyone can send you a message, but only you can read it. We created a script that lets you send an email message to your friend that is securely encrypted so that only your friend can read it. To do this, our script uses the RSA algoritm, which is one of the most widely used public-key encryption algorithms.\n",
